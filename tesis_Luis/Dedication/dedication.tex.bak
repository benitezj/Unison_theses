I would like to thank my wife El\'izabeth for her unconditional support in the challenges I set myself, without her this would not be possible. To my advisor, Dr. Jos\'e Ben\'itez, for giving me guidance, patience and, above all, the opportunity to work in such a professional team and join the CMS experiment, that was a dream for me. To the University of Sonora and CONACYT for supporting me in completing this important challenge in my professional career.
