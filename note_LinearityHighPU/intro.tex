In Run III and HL-LHC phases, the LHC is expected to run at peak instantenous luminosities of about 2\ \instlumiunit\ and 5-7\ \instlumiunit, respectively \cite{hllhc}.
For the HL-LHC the proton bunch intensities will increase and will cause the pileup to reach peak values of 140-200, by comparison the Run II average pileup was about 34 with peak values around 50. 
During 2018, runs with special trigger configuration were recorded with pileup up to 100, these runs allow for studies of the effects of high pileup on the relative linearity between luminometers.
The luminosity measurement based on Pixel Cluster Counting (PCC) \cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-12-001,CMS-PAS-LUM-13-001,PCC2016_publicplots} method is expected to have a good linearity to high pileup due to its fine granularity.
